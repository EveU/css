        <h2>Cats</h2>
        <p>
          The cat is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species
          in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish
          it from wild members of the family. The cat is either a house cat or a farm
          cat, which are pets, or a feral cat, which ranges freely and avoids human
          contact. Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">Wikipedia</a>
